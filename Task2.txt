2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

Ans:
-> Objects in Javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference
   types, in the form of "key:Value" pairs.These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties 
   methods, in the context of an object.

-> Here is an example of an object and its internal representation in Javascript.
     const person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 25,
        occupation: "Doctor"
     }

    In this example, the object is represented as a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings, and the 
     values can be any javascript value, including other objects.

-> Objects are a powerful way to represent data in JavaScript.They can be used to model real-world objects,such as people,
   cars, products.They can also be used to store data structures, such as lists and trees. Objects are essential part of JavaScript,
   and they are almost used in every Javascript program.

-> Some key features of objects in JavaScript:
   1. Objects are Dynamic: Means we can add and remove properties from an object at any time. 
   2. Objects are Extensible: Means we can create new types of objects by adding new properties and methods to existing objects.
   3. Objects are first-Class: Means we can pass objects to functions, return objects from functions and assign objects to variables.
